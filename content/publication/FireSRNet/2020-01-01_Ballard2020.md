abstract: "With fires becoming increasingly frequent and severe across the globe in recent years, understanding climate changeâ€™s role in fire behavior is critical for quantifying current and future fire risk. How- ever, global climate models typically simulate fire behavior at spatial scales too coarse for local risk assessments. Therefore, we propose a novel approach towards super-resolution (SR) enhancement of fire risk exposure maps that incorporates not only 2000 to 2020 monthly satellite observations of active fires but also local information on land cover and temperature. Inspired by SR architectures, we pro- pose an efficient deep learning model trained for SR on fire risk exposure maps. We evaluate this model on resolution enhancement and find it outperforms standard image interpolation techniques at both 4x and 8x enhancement while having comparable performance at 2x enhancement. We then demonstrate the generalizability of this SR model over northern California and New South Wales, Australia. We conclude with a discussion and application of our proposed model to climate model simulations of fire risk in 2040 and 2100, illustrating the potential for SR enhancement of fire risk maps from the latest state-of-the-art climate models."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Advances in image super-resolution have led to the ability to generate strikingly photo-realistic images from low-resolution inputs. Inspired by these models, we create high-resolution maps of future wildfire risk, incorporating satellite observations, weather data, and climate models.
