I am a statistical research scientist passionate about developing AI/ML models for social good, enabling the next generation of sustainability. My research has been published in top journals and academic conferences (NeurIPS, AAAI, ICLR).

I have led or collaborated on a variety of projects building and productizing computer vision, large language models, and other statistical models, including topics on climate modeling, remote sensing, extreme events, Bayesian model averaging, and more. I have 8+ years coding experience in Python and R, along with experience developing AI models in deep learning frameworks PyTorch and Keras.
